title:  CS451/651 -  Reading Assignment 
---

You will be responsible for providing the following *four dimential* response
for each paper we cover this semester. Your responses will be submitted to be
prior to each lecture, and I will take your replies into consideration while
framing that lectures discussion.

#### Instructions:
1. Responses should be in your own words based on your own impression of the
   reading. While it is OK to agree with the authors, you should not copy
   their language directly. 
2. Responses should be brief, the longest being at most one paragraph in length.
3. **Reponses must submitted by 10:00pm on the evening before the lecture**

#### Tips: 
+ Think about these questions as your read each paper. With time,
   responding should become easier, and your responses more knowledgable.
+ Don't worry about being objectively correct, your responses should be based solely on your
   individual impression of the material.
