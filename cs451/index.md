# Course Syllabus 
Distributed Systems (CS451/CS651) is a fast-paced, hands-on introduction to the
fundamentals of modern distributed software systems.  This course is built around a
case-study of real-world systems, and covers the
fundamental concepts, problems and techniques the define them.  The lectures
are structured as a graduate-level seminar, and stresses an individual's ability
to review research papers and independently explore the ideas.  Major topics include fault tolerance,
replication, and consistency.

The reading list and programming assignments for the course draw heavily from 
[MIT 6.824](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/) and owes much of its
credit to Robert Morris, Frans Kaashoek and Nickolai Zeldovich who
helped developed the material. It is with great admiration and
appreciation that we offer this course to CS students at Boston University.

#### Formal Course Description
Programming-centric introduction to how networks of computers are structured
to operate as coherent single system. Introducing principles of architecture,
processes, communications, naming, synchronization, consistency and
replication, fault tolerance and security, and paradigms such as web-based,
object-based, file systems, and coordination-based.


## Requirements
**This is a challenging course** designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate-level computer science students. If you are unsure about your preparation for this course, please email one of the instructors as soon as possible. 

#### Textbook
There is no required textbook for this class. 

#### Formal Prerequisites

Students are required to have completed **CS 112 and CS 210** (or
equivalent) before taking this course. In addition, having completed **CS 455** or **CS 452** is highly recommended 
 but not required.  

### Course Workload 

_This course is challenging_ and you will be expected to contribute a
substantial amount of time towards homework and assignments. 
The coursework includes reading academic papers, semester-long 
programming assignments, a written midterm and final exam, and a "graduate" project (
for those enrolled in CS651.)

The class consists of two lectures and one discussion per week. Most lectures require that you to read a research paper and complete a 
short written assignment. Be prepared to contribute to in-class conversation by finishing the required reading ahead before class. Discussion sections will focus on the programming assignments, including the opportunity for debugging and grading assistance. 


Four programming assignment "labs" (using the **GO pragramming language**)
will require a good deal of time and effort.  These assignments have been
uniquely designed to help develops your skills in building and debugging
distributed, fault-tolerant software.  Previous knowledge of the GO language
is useful, but not required. However, you are expected to be comfortable
learning new languages and tools, reading existing codebases, designing
from-scratch solutions, and debugging (_so much debugging..._). 

The require paper readings will be posted ahead of time via the course calendar page.
Written assignment will be due **by 10pm** the evening prior to the morning
lecture. If a lecture is postponed due to weather or illness the
corresponding written assignment is also postponed.  

The midterm exam will be given in-class (tentatively, on March 1st). The final exam will be given during
the time scheduled by the college.  Programming assignment will be due in multiple phases, with
an individual phase due every couple weeks throughout the term. Required readings,
due dates and exam dates will be posted on the course calendar page.
Updates to the schedule will be made throughout the semester and all changes will
be also announced via Piazza.  

### Grade Breakdown
> Programming Labs: 50%  Paper Reading: 15%   
> Midterm Exam: 15%   Final Exam: 20%  

### CS651 Additional Requirements 
For graduate credit for this course (e.g., individual enrolled in CS651)
you are required to complete **graduate semester projec** in addition to the regular
assignments and exams.  Detail and options for the project will be discussed
once the course is underway.

# Academic Honesty

All assignments must be completed individually unless stated otherwise. Group
discussion of topic and issues is highly encouraged, but representing the work
of another as your own is expressly forbidden. This includes the use of
solution code that may be available online, which can be verified using an automated plagiarism detector.
**Cheating will not be tolerated under any circumstances.**

See the [CAS Academic Conduct
Code](http://www.bu.edu/cas/students/undergrad-resources/code/), in particular
regarding plagiarism and cheating on exams. Copies of the CAS Academic Conduct
Code are also available in room CAS 105. A student suspected to violate this
code will be reported to the Academic Conduct Committee, and if found
culpable, the student will receive a grade of "F" for the course. Please don't cheat.
