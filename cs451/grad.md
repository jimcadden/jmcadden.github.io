title:  CS651 - Graduate Project 
description: Project Details for CS651, Spring 2018 
---

#### Proposals Due: March 30

#### Survey Talks Date: April 26

#### Project Demos Date: May 1st

#### Written Material Due: May 2nd 

---

The final theme of this semester will be a look at **blockchain** (aka.
distributed ledger) technology from a _distributed systems perspective_.  That
is, a look at the fundamental distributed concepts, problems and techniques
that define it.  This study will include three formal lectures with assigned
readings, and two periods dedicated to blockchain-oriented presentations and
demonstrations from the graduate students enrolled in the class. 

Participation is required for all cs651 students, and optional for enrolled in
cs451 (extra credit).  Students may work individually, or in teams (up to 5
people). 

There are two options for the project: 

1. **Survey Paper & Talk** (1-3 people)
1. **Development Project & Demo** (2-5 people)

All projects includes both a written deliverable and a live presentation
(although the lengths of each vary).  Projects must be approved by the course
instructor, and should be submitted to <jmcadden@bu.edu> no later than 
March 30th.

> **NOTE**: Our lectures will be focused on the world of _post-cryptocurrency_ blockchains, so I recommend your proposed topics **avoid** being _only about cryptocurrency_. 

## Option One -  Survey Paper & Talk

Select a topic that closely related to blockchain technology and write a brief
(3-5 page) survey paper, and prepare a short 25 minute talk about the subject.

The format of the paper should be double-column, 12-point, and no longer than
5 pages (without references).

You topic should be an active area of blockchain research or use. Therefore,
your paper should references published sources on the chosen subject. The
focus of your paper and talk should be on the _distributed_ aspects of your
chosen subject (e.g, transactions, concurrency, fault tolerance, large-scale
uses) opposed to its societal or economic aspects.

#### Some possible survey topics (you are encouraged to proposed you own):
> + Authenticity / Validation
> + Consensus  
> + Sharding 

## Option Two - Development Project & Demo

Propose and build a project using blockchain technology. You focus should be a
useful and new use case for blockchain, with emphasis on its distributed
qualities. The more interesting and challenging, the better! 

You'll turn in your code and a short (2-3 page) write-up describing the design
and implementation of your project, and make a short in-class presentation and
demo of the work. You have no limits to the programming language or software
platform that you use, but your final write-up must clearly state what
material you've produced versus that which you've borrowed.  

#### Some possible coding projects (you are encouraged to proposed you own):
> + Peer-to-peer game
> + Peer-to-peer messaging (WhatsApp)
> + Decentralized content platform (Reddit/Medium/Facebook)
> + AirBnB-like platform leasing/trading 
> + Plagiarism authentication system
