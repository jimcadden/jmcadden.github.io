title:  CS651 Graduate Project 
description: Project Details for CS651, Spring 2018 
---

### Due Dates:

Project Proposal (one per team): **March 30**

Team Talks: **April 26**

Team Demos: **May 1st**

Project Report (one per team): **May 2nd**

---

The final topic of this semester be a look at **blockchain** (aka.
distributed ledger) technology from a _distributed systems perspective_.  That
is, a look at the fundamental concepts, problems and techniques
that define it.  This study will include three formal lectures with assigned
readings, and two periods dedicated to _blockchain-oriented_ presentations and
demonstrations from the graduate students enrolled in the class. There maybe
an additional poster session at the end of the semester. 

Participation is required for cs651 students, and optional for students enrolled in
cs451 (extra credit).  Students may work individually, or in teams. 

There are two options for the project: 

1. **Survey Paper & Talk** (1-3 people)
1. **Development Project & Demo** (2-5 people)

All projects includes both a written deliverable and a live presentation
(although the lengths of each vary).  **All projects must be gain prior approval by the course
instructor** Come to office hours to discus your ideas. A written proposal (one per team) must be submitted to <jmcadden@bu.edu> no later than March 30th (the sooner the better!).

<p class="bold centered highlighter">
> **NOTE**: Lectures will largely focus on the _post-cryptocurrency_ applicability of blockchains, so I highly recommend that your proposed projects **avoids** a focus _entirely_ about cryptocurrencies. 
</p>

# Option One -  Survey Paper & Talk

Select a topic that closely related to blockchain technology and write a brief
(3-5 page) survey paper, and prepare a short 25 minute talk about the subject.

The format of the paper should be double-column, 12-point, and no longer than
5 pages (without references).

You topic should be an active area of blockchain research or use. Therefore,
your paper should references published sources on the chosen subject. The
focus of your paper and talk should be on the _distributed_ aspects of your
chosen subject (e.g, transactions, concurrency, fault tolerance, large-scale
uses) opposed to its societal or economic aspects.

Some possible survey topics (you also encouraged to propose you own):
 + Authenticity / Validation
 + Consensus  
 + Sharding 

> **Proposal write-up should contain the following:**
> + Team members
> + Short description of survey subject
> + Initial citation list

# Option Two - Development Project & Demo

Propose and build a project using blockchain technology. You focus should be a
useful and new use case for blockchain, with emphasis on its distributed
qualities. The more interesting and challenging, the better! 

You'll turn in your code and a short (2-3 page) write-up describing the design
and implementation of your project, and make a short in-class 
demo of your work. You have no restrictions to the programming languages or software
platforms that you utilize, but your write-up must clearly state what
material you started with and what you produced.  

Some possible coding projects (you are also encouraged to propose you own):
 + Peer-to-peer game
 + Peer-to-peer messaging (WhatsApp)
 + Decentralized content platform (Reddit/Medium/Facebook)
 + AirBnB-like platform for leasing/trading 
 + Plagiarism authentication system

> **Proposal write-up should contain the following:**
> + Team members
> + Description of the project idea and goal
> + Description of your in-class demonstration 
> + Technical approach / development plan 
> + List of external resources you'll use (frameworks, libraries)
