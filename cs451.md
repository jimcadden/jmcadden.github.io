# Course Syllabus 

Distributed Systems (CS451/651) is a fast-paced, hands-on introduction to the
fundamentals of modern distributed systems.  This course is built around a
case-study of real-world distributed software systems, and covers the
fundamental concepts, problems and techniques the define them.  The class is
structured  as a graduate-level seminar, and stresses an individual's ability
to consume research papers and independently explore the ideas. A
semester-long programming assignment develops skills designing and debugging
distributed and fault-tolerant software. Major topics include fault tolerance,
replication, and consistency.

**This course is challenging** and you should expect to contribute a
_substantial amount of time_ to it each week. In particular, for each lecture
you will be required a read 10-12 page research paper and prepare as short
written response. In addition, the course has a *heavy programming
component*, using the **GO pragramming language**. Previous knowledge of GO
is useful, but not required. You should, however, be comfortable learning new
languages and tools, reading existing codebases, designing from-scratch
solutions, and debugging. _So much debugging..._

<!--programming experience will be helpful for the lab assignments.-->
>The reading list and programming assignments for the course draw heavily from 
[MIT 6.824](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/) and owes much of its
credit to Robert Morris, Frans Kaashoek and Nickolai Zeldovich who
helped developed the material. It is with great admiration and
appreciation that we offer this course to CS students at Boston University.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites required for this course are **CS 112** and **CS 210**.
Students without the prerequisites are not be allowed to enroll in the course.
Having taken either **CS 455** or **CS 452** is also considered extremely
useful, but not required.  If you you are unsure about your preparation please
see the instructor.

## Requirements 

The coursework includes weekly readings, monthly programming assignments, an
midterm, and a final exam.  Each class will be focused on an paper, which
will be lectured upon and then discussed.  You should have the paper read
before coming to class, and be prepared to contribute to conversation about
it. For each class you will be asked to write and submit a short summary
and/or response to a posted question about the paper.  We will post question
at least 24 hours before the beginning of class. Your submitted
summary/solutions only be long enough to demonstrate that you understand the
material (a paragraph will do).  Will have an exam during class in the middle
of the term, and a final exam during finals week.  There is a programming
assignment due every few weeks throughout the term.

#### Textbook
There is no required textbook for this class. 

### CS651 Additional Requirements 
TBA

### Grade Breakdown
TBA

### Formal Course Description
Programming-centric introduction to how networks of computers are structured
to operate as coherent single system. Introducing principles of architecture,
processes, communications, naming, synchronization, consistency and
replication, fault tolerance and security, and paradigms such as web-based,
object-based, file systems, and coordination-based.

# Academic Honesty

Assignments must be completed individually. Discussion of issues in is
encouraged, but representing the work of another person as your own is
expressly forbidden. This may includes the use of  outside sourcecode
available online. We may use an automated plagiarism checker. 

**Cheating will not be tolerated under any circumstances.**

See the [CAS Academic Conduct
Code](http://www.bu.edu/cas/students/undergrad-resources/code/), in particular
regarding plagiarism and cheating on exams. Copies of the CAS Academic Conduct
Code are also available in room CAS 105. A student suspected to violate this
code will be reported to the Academic Conduct Committee, and if found
culpable, the student will receive a grade of "F" for the course.
