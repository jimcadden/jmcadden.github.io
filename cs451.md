# Course Syllabus 
Distributed Systems (CS451/CS651) is a fast-paced, hands-on introduction to the
fundamentals of modern distributed software systems.  This course is built around a
case-study of real-world systems, and covers the
fundamental concepts, problems and techniques the define them.  The lectures
are structured as a graduate-level seminar, and stresses an individual's ability
to review research papers and independently explore the ideas.  Major topics include fault tolerance,
replication, and consistency.

The reading list and programming assignments for the course draw heavily from 
[MIT 6.824](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/) and owes much of its
credit to Robert Morris, Frans Kaashoek and Nickolai Zeldovich who
helped developed the material. It is with great admiration and
appreciation that we offer this course to CS students at Boston University.

#### Formal Course Description
Programming-centric introduction to how networks of computers are structured
to operate as coherent single system. Introducing principles of architecture,
processes, communications, naming, synchronization, consistency and
replication, fault tolerance and security, and paradigms such as web-based,
object-based, file systems, and coordination-based.


## Requirements
**This is a challenging course** designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate-level computer science students. If you are unsure about your preparation for this course, please email one of the instructors as soon as possible. 

#### Formal Prerequisites

Students are required to have completed **CS 112 and CS 210** (or
equivalent) before taking this course. In addition, having completed **CS 455** or **CS 452** is highly recommended 
 but not required.  

### Expectations

_This course is challenging_ and you will be expected to contribute a
substantial amount of time towards homework and assignments. 
The coursework includes reading academic papers, complex semester-long 
programming assignments, a written midterm and final exam, and CS651 final project (only
for those enrolled for graduate credit.)

The class consists of two lectures and one discussion per week. Most lectures require you to read a research paper and complete a 
short written assignment beforehand . Be prepared to contribute to conversation that accompany the lectures finished the required reading ahead of time. Discussion sections will focus on the ongoing programming assignments, and will include opportunity for assistance and grading. 


A semester-long programming assignment using the **GO pragramming language**
will help develops your skills inn designing and debugging distributed,
fault-tolerant software.  Previous knowledge of the GO language is useful, but
not required. However, you are expected to be comfortable learning new
languages and tools, reading existing codebases, designing from-scratch
solutions, and debugging (_oh! so much debugging..._). 

The require reading will be posted ahead of time via the course calendar.
Written assignment will be due **by 10pm** the evening prior the morning
lecture. If a lecture is postponed due to weather or illness, the
corresponding written assignment due date is also postponed.  

The midterm exam will be given in-class, and the final exam given during
final's week.  Programming assignment are broken into multiple parts, with
individual parts due every couple weeks throughout the term. Required reading,
assignment due dates and exam dates will be posted onto the course calendar.
Updates to the calendar will be made throughout the semester and changes will
be announced via the course Piazza page.  


### CS651 Additional Requirements 
To earn graduate credit for this course (e.g., individual enrolled in CS651)
you will be required to complete semester project in addition to the regular
assignments and exams.  Detail and option for this project will be discussed
once the course is underway. 

#### Textbook
There is no required textbook for this class.

# Academic Honesty

All assignments must be completed individually unless stated otherwise. Group
discussion of topic and issues is highly encouraged, but representing the work
of another as your own is expressly forbidden. This includes the use of
solution code that may be available online, which can be verified using an automated plagiarism detector.
**Cheating will not be tolerated under any circumstances.**

See the [CAS Academic Conduct
Code](http://www.bu.edu/cas/students/undergrad-resources/code/), in particular
regarding plagiarism and cheating on exams. Copies of the CAS Academic Conduct
Code are also available in room CAS 105. A student suspected to violate this
code will be reported to the Academic Conduct Committee, and if found
culpable, the student will receive a grade of "F" for the course, which may
then constitute a life of shame and embarrassment. Please don't cheat.
