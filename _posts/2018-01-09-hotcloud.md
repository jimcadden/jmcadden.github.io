# Summary

This document acts as rough paper outline detailing our submission to HotCloud 2018. 

This vision paper argues that an "elastic" application runtime, a distributed
set of LibraryOS instances, is necessary for enabling fine-grain elasticity at
scale.  

This paper argues for a radical redesign of the cloud software stack, from
multiple tiers of legacy interfaces and middleware, to a "flattened"
distributed library operating system dedicated to an single application or
language runtime.   

The motivation for this shift is finally enable cloud applications the ability
to fully exploit the  immense scale and fine-grain elasticity provided by the
underlying cloud utility.  This becomes necessary as the _instantaneous
concurrency_ demands of cloud applications exceed what is readily available in
pre-allocated resource.  As fast, fine-grain resource demands of the
application push the underlying "system" to be expended, the scale and
performance of the application is inhibited by the _inflexible_ properties of
the software stack which the application depends on. 

**Hypothesis:** By removing and condensing the existing "dependency layers" of
the cloud software stack, we enable a distributed application runtime that is
agile enough to grow to consume one to many dedicated CPUs, and back again,
at the pace of the underlying resource utility provider.

<!-- # Scratch 

These layers include cloud
infrastructure "services" (PaaS, FaaS, many SaaS), a myriad of
application "micro-services", language runtimes, containers, traditional
operating systems, and virtualisation.

Fine-grain elasticity is the dynamic (on-demand) allocation/deallocations that
is fast, one to many CPUs. Scale capable of consuming the resources of many
_physical_ machines.
